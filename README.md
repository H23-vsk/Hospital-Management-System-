This is a console-based Hospital Management System developed in C++. The system allows a hospital to admit and discharge patients while storing patient information in a file for persistence. It is designed to demonstrate basic file handling, classes, and object-oriented programming concepts in C++.

The system performs the following operations:

Admit Patient:
Allows the user to enter patient details such as name, address, and blood group, and stores this information in a text file.

Discharge Patient:
Removes a patient’s record from the system based on the patient’s name and updates the stored file accordingly.

Exit:
Safely exits the program.

Features

Simple and user-friendly console menu.

Uses file handling to persist patient data.

Demonstrates class usage in C++.

Supports multiple patient records.

Technologies Used

C++ for programming.

File handling for data storage.

Windows.h for console clearing and delays.

Usage

Clone the repository.

Open the project in a C++ compiler (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio).

Compile and run the program.

Use the menu to admit or discharge patients.
